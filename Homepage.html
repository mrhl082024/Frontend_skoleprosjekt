        Welcome to my first attempt of a Dark souls 3 wiki. The goal of this
        project, is to slowly over time add stuff from the video game onto this
        site, for informative or guide purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the top of this page there will be a row of buttons, at the moment
        they dont do anything. But in the future, my plan is to expand on the
        design, so it will be easy for anyone who visits this site, to find what
        information they're seeking.
